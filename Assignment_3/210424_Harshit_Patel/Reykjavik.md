## Approach

> In **main** function, address **0x2400** is called but there is no instruction at address **0x2400**. Somehow instructions will be placed at 0x2400 before the actual call. Place a breakpoint at **0x4438** and execute to get the instruction at **0x2400**. Use a disassembler to get the instructions.
