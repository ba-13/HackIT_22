## UNIX filesystem
![UNIX filesystem](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Intro_Unix_Text/Images/unix_file_system.png)       

Unix filesystem is a logical collection of files on a storage space . It sorts the files into their respective directories . Everything is considered as files including drivers and physical devices . At the very top of the file system is a directory called “root” which is represented by a “/”.  All other files are “descendants” of root. 

Some of the commands for managing and acessing files are given below .



+ pwd - gives the name of the present working directory
  ```bash 
  pwd 
   ```
+ cd - changes the working dirctory to another directory (say diectory_1)
  ```bash
  cd directory_1
  ```
+ man - gives information about a command (say com_1)
  ```bash
  man com_1
  ```
+ df - shows the space left in the storage
  ```bash
  df
  ```
+ du - shows the space used in the storage
  ```bash
  du
  ```
+ touch - used to create new file (say newfile.x)
  ```bash
  touch newfile.x
  ```
+ cat - used to print the content of a file (say file_1)
  ```bash
  cat file_1
  ```
+ ls - used to list out all the things in the currnt directory
   ```bash
  ls
  ```
+ mkdir - used to create a new directory (say ndir)
  ```bash
  mkdir ndir
  ```
+ rm - used to remove files and directories
  ```bash
  rm file.x
  ```
+ mv - used to move things from one place to other
  ```bash
  mv <old_place> <new_place>
  ```
+ cp - used to copy things
  ```bash
  cp <Original> <Duplicate>
  ```
+ history - shows all the previous commands
  ```bash
  history
  ```
+ su - used to switch to another user (say user_2)
  ```bash
  su user_2
  ```
For each of these commands, there are arguments like -a,-b etc which helps to handle files in a more efficient way.

## vim
vim is an advanced and highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It has many features so that you can complete your editing without removing hands from the key board.   
When you open the file with vim, it will take you to the command mode.
```
  vim file.x
  ```
You can navigate through the file with the following commands
+ h - moves the cursor one character to the left.
+ j - moves the cursor down one line.
+ k - moves the cursor up one line.
+ l - moves the cursor one character to the right.

You can type i to enter insert mode from command mode and you can insert whatever you like by navigating through it .  
You can type esc to come back to the command mode from the insert mode.  
+ Use :q in the command mode to escape the vim.  
+ Use :w in the command mode to write the file.  
+ Use :wq in the command mode to write the file and escape the vim.
