# The Unix Filesystem

The unix filesystem is a method of organizing data and information into various databases (inside which resides "files" which store the data) or folders in a way that makes it easy and convinient to store and access it from the terminal using some commands.

The Ubuntu Terminal:-

##
### Some Basic Commands 

- ```cd```:- used to navigate to the home directory; cd (directory) will take
you to that directory
- ```ls```:- used to find out all the files in the current directory
- ```pwd``` used to know the present working directory
- ```mkdir```used to create a new directory
- ```touch```used to create a new file in the directory
- ```rmdir```used to delete a new directory

-Sometimes the current user doesnt have the required permissions to perform specific tasks. In such cases the "sudo" command can be which (sudo requires password verification) which elevates the current user.

# Vim

Vim, on the other hand, is a fast, small and powerful text editor that comes along with ubuntu and can be accessed from the terminal by typing "vim" in the command prompt. It can be used with the usage of only the keyboard.

Once the user types vim in the terminal the following screen pops up:

![vim](vimm.png)

to quit one can just type :q which will return to the terminal.

Alternatively, to open a file in vim, one can use the cd command to go the directory where the file is present and use "vim file" to open the file in the vim interface. 

Initially when vim opens, it is in the command mode.
Some command mode functions are:

- ```:help``` - searches and gives documentation for whatever command
- ```:q``` - quits the editor
-  ```:e [file]``` - opens a file
- ```:q!``` - quits without saving
- ```:w [filename]``` - writes to file (add path to the end of :w to write to a new file)


Anathor mode is the insert mode which, as the name suggests, is used to insert text into the file. To go the insert mode, one can just type i (INSERT shows on the bottom left, signifying that the editor is in insert mode). To return to the command mode, just press the escape key.

In the command mode, using the arrow keys is enough to navigate through the file. Vim also has some shortcuts which allows easy navigation:-

- ```w``` :- move to the next word
- ```B``` :- move to the previous word
- ```b``` :- move to the beginning of the word
- ```e``` :- move to the end of the word
- ```b``` :- move to the previous word
- ```0``` :- move to the beginning of the line
- ```$``` :- move to the end of the line

and many more keys.
