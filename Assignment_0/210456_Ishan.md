## UNIX file system

-UNIX file system provides with a way to reach any file on one's PC using Command line interface, it is divided into directories and uses a tree interface to simplify things further

-some useful commands to navigate and interact are:

    cd-command to enter root directory
        cd.. :to go back to previous directory
        cd/ : to go to home directory
    ls-lists components of folder alone
        ls -l: long listing of files in directory
        ls -a: causes hidden files to be listed
    man 'command': manual to 'command'
        man ls: gives manual to ls command
    rm: deletes specific file
        rm xyz: deletes file named xyz
        rm xyz abc: deletes file named xyz and abc
        rm xyz*: deletes files with xyz prefix
    cp: to copy files and and even whole directories
    grep: to find a given line
        just like the one we used in Q3
    sudo:gives privileges of another user (often the superuser)
        sudo apt-get xyz
    su: is used to give commands as another user
        su user -c command
    pwd: locating the directory currently placed in
    mkdir: creates new folder

## vim

-vim is a very versatile and a lightweight program, although it might look hard to use on the surface but with enough practice and getting used to it can increase productivity by a lot

-vim is a UNIX text editor and can be integrated with VS code for a more user friendly experience, it just uses vimm interface and keybinds

-Installing vim:
    1) vim can be installed by using sudo ap-get vim in LINUX and open a file using vim 'filename'
    2) in VS code it can be installed by extensions and then open

-when a file is opened in vim it will take you to commannd mode and you can switch to insert mode by pressing 'i' and write to the file

-to exit insert mode simply press 'esc'

-in command mode some basic keybinds are mentioned below

    h: navigate left

    j: navigate down

    k:navigate up

    l:navigate right

    w:jump to start of word

    e:jump to end of word

    0:jump to the start of the line

    :q : quit vim

    :w : write (save) the file

    :wq : write and escape

    yy: yank (copy) a line

    p: paste a line
