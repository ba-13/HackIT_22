## Approach

- I started with the burpsuite intercept feature, and used it to intercept information as I entered snickerdoodle or wafer.
- As Burpsuite displayed various information on each step, I noticed that the "Cookie: name=X" element where X was a number which was varying with my input, hence I started changing it manually to obtain the flag for name=18.
