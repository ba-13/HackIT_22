# Scavenger Hunt

## Approach

- So I started with inspecting the code.
- Got the first part in index.html
- Got the second part in the css file
- Tried searching for the third part in the .js file but it contained the clue to the third part.
- Hence, found the remaining flags in /robots.txt, /.htaccess, /.DS_Store following the clues along the way.

## Flag

- picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_f7ce8828}
