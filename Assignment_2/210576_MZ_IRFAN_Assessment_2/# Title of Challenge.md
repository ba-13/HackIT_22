On opening the link in the problem I saw the word written on search bar written as snickerdoodle i search this and read the message "I love snickerdoodle" then i move to inspect where i saw the application section here i saw value corresponding to snickerdoodle which was 1 and then i tried another cookie  biscotti now i find that value equal to 10 so i started changing my values and started getting diffrent types of cookoies finally at 18 i got my answer.
