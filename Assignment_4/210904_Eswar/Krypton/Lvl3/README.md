# Level 3 Walkthrough

## Password to Level 4
+ WELLDONETHELEVELFOURPQSSWORDISBRUTE

## Description
```
Well done.  You've moved past an easy substitution cipher.

Hopefully you just encrypted the alphabet a plaintext 
to fully expose the key in one swoop.

The main weakness of a simple substitution cipher is 
repeated use of a simple key.  In the previous exercise
you were able to introduce arbitrary plaintext to expose
the key.  In this example, the cipher mechanism is not 
available to you, the attacker.

However, you have been lucky.  You have intercepted more
than one message.  The password to the next level is found
in the file 'krypton4'.  You have also found 3 other files.
(found1, found2, found3)

You know the following important details:

- The message plaintexts are in English (*** very important)
- They were produced from the same key (*** even better!)


Enjoy.
