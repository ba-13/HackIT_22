# Level 1 Walkthrough

## Password to Level 2
+ LEVEL TWO PASSWORD ROTTEN  

## Description
``` 
The first level is easy.  The password for level 2 is in the file 
'krypton2'.  It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13.  
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for
cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, 
regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.

This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to
the cipher text.

Enjoy!

Decrypting the krypton2 with rot13 gives the password
