# Level 4 Walkthrough

> Use a vigenere-cipher decoder (like https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher) and input *found1* and *found2*, we find the key to be `FREKEY`, use the key to decode `HCIKV RJOX`![Lvl4a](../assets/Lvl4a.png)![Lvl4b](../assets/Lvl4b.png)

## Password to Level 5

> Password is `CLEARTEXT`

> Good job!
You more than likely used frequency analysis and some common sense
to solve that one.
So far we have worked with simple substitution ciphers.  They have
also been 'monoalphabetic', meaning using a fixed key, and
giving a one to one mapping of plaintext (P) to ciphertext (C).
Another type of substitution cipher is referred to as 'polyalphabetic',
where one character of P may map to many, or all, possible ciphertext
characters.
An example of a polyalphabetic cipher is called a Vigenere Cipher.  It works
like this:
If we use the key(K)  'GOLD', and P = PROCEED MEETING AS AGREED, then "add"
P to K, we get C.  When adding, if we exceed 25, then we roll to 0 (modulo 26).
P     P R O C E   E D M E E   T I N G A   S A G R E   E D
K     G O L D G   O L D G O   L D G O L   D G O L D   G O
becomes:
P     15 17 14 2  4  4  3 12  4 4  19  8 13 6  0  18 0  6 17 4 4   3
K     6  14 11 3  6 14 11  3  6 14 11  3  6 14 11  3 6 14 11 3 6  14
C     21 5  25 5 10 18 14 15 10 18  4 11 19 20 11 21 6 20  2 8 10 17
So, we get a ciphertext of:
VFZFK SOPKS ELTUL VGUCH KR
This level is a Vigenï¿½re Cipher.  You have intercepted two longer, english
language messages.  You also have a key piece of information.  You know the
key length!
For this exercise, the key length is 6.  The password to level five is in the usual
place, encrypted with the 6 letter key.
Have fun!
