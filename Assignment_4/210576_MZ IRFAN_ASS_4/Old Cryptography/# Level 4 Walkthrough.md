# Level 3 Walkthrough

## Password to Level 4
BRUTE

## Description
Well done.  You've moved past an easy substitution cipher.

Hopefully you just encrypted the alphabet a plaintext
to fully expose the key in one swoop.

The main weakness of a simple substitution cipher is
repeated use of a simple key.  In the previous exercise
you were able to introduce arbitrary plaintext to expose
the key.  In this example, the cipher mechanism is not
available to you, the attacker.

However, you have been lucky.  You have intercepted more
than one message.  The password to the next level is found
in the file 'krypton4'.  You have also found 3 other files.
(found1, found2, found3)

You know the following important details:

- The message plaintexts are in English (*** very important)
- They were produced from the same key (*** even better!)


Enjoy.

in cryptography a caesar cipher also known as a caesars cipher the shift cipher caesars code or caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques it is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet for example with a shift of a would be replaced by db would become e and soon the method is named after julius caesar who used it to communicate with his generals the encryption step performed by a caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes such as the vigenre cipher and still has modern application in the rot system as with all single alphabet substitution ciphers the caesar cipher is easily broken and in practice offers essentially no communication security shakespeare produced most of his known work between and his early plays were mainly comedies and histories genre she raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century next he wrote mainly tragedies until about including hamlet king lear and macbeth considered some of the finest examples in the english language in his last phase he wrote tragicomedies also known as romances and collaborated with other playwrights many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime and in two of his former theatrical colleagues published the first folio a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as shakespeares although no attendance records for the period survive most biographers agree that shakespeare was educated at the kings new school in stratford a free school chartered in about a quarter of a mile from his home grammar schools varied in quality during the elizabethan era but the curriculum was dictated by law throughout england and the school would have provided an intensive education in latin grammar and the classics at the age of shakespeare married the year old anne hathaway the consistory court of the diocese of worcester issued a marriage licence on november two of hathaways neighbours posted bonds the next day as surety that there were no impediments to the marriage the couple may have arranged the ceremony in some haste since the worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times annes pregnancy could have been the reason for this six months after the marriage she gave birth to a daughter susanna who was baptised on may twins son hamnet and daughter judith followed almost two years later and were baptised on february ham net died of unknown causes at the age of and was buried on august after the birth of the twins there are few historical traces of shakespeare until he is mentioned as part of the london theatre scene in because of this gap scholars refer to the years between and as shakespeares lost years biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories nicholas rowe shakespeares first biographer recounted a stratford legend that shakespeare fled the town for london to escape prosecution for deer poaching another eighteenth century story has shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in london john aubrey reported that shakespeare had been a country school master some twentieth century scholars have suggested that shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by alexander hoghton of lancashire a catholic landowner who named a certain william shakesh aftein his will no evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death hereupon le grand arose with a grave and stately air and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed it was a beautiful scarabaeus and at that time unknown to naturalists of course a great prize in a scientific point of view there were two round black spots near one extremity of the back and a long one near the other the scales were exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance of burnished gold the weight of the insect was very remarkable and taking all things into consideration i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it  well done the level four password is brute
